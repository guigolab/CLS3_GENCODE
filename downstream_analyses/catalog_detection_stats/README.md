#### 1. Plots the % target regions detected overall, further differentiating the novel and known regions, in addition to displaying the number of catalog regions and transcripts (CLS3 transcripts/intron chains)
#### 2. Plots novel transcripts (CLS3 transcripts/intron chains) as well as the proportion of target regions that help detect novel transcripts, thanks to the target catalog
