# Recount3 Support
A metric we employed to assess the quality of our models at the splice-junction was the level of expression of each splicing reaction (as opposed to the expression of the overall transcript) using short-read data processed by the recount3[^38] project.

Processed recount data are available for [Human](https://zenodo.org/api/records/13946596/draft/files/hg38_recoung3.gff3.gz/content) and [Mouse](https://zenodo.org/api/records/13946596/draft/files/m38_recount3.bed.gz/content).

Support as been computed as follow:
