# CLS3_GENCODEv47
## Charting thousands of novel gene loci through targeted full-length long-read RNA sequencing
GENCODE is a 20-year international project focused on producing high-quality annotations for human and mouse genomes, crucial for understanding gene function. While the human gene catalog for protein-coding genes is nearly complete, long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) annotations have remained inconsistent across different catalogs. To address this, GENCODE used targeted RNA sequencing to unify and expand lncRNA annotations in human and mouse, employing full-length sequencing across diverse tissues. This effort resulted in 16,817 new human genes and 22,210 new mouse genes, significantly increasing the lncRNA catalog and improving orthology mapping between species. These new annotations enhance the functional interpretation of genome data, linking previously unannotated regions to biological functions.
